# LoanApprovalPrediction

The idea behind this ML project is to build a model for a bank which wants to automate the loan eligibility process based on customer details provided through the application form. These details are gender, martial status, education, employment, dependents, income, loan amount, credit history, etc... We have to automate the process to identify the customer segments, those are eligible for a loan so that we can specifically target these customers. This is a standard supervised classification problem where we have to predict whether a customer is eliglible for that loan or not.
